            <h2>Blockchains</h2>
            <p>Mining is keeping track of transactions in a “blockchain”, a register that keeps track of all the transactions in the history of bitcoin. This blockchain is stored in computers that are part of the bitcoin mining network. The blockchain keeps track of every single bitcoin transaction that has ever happened. So far it houses over 107 gigabytes of data. This method is good for keeping track of the number of bitcoins there are but wouldn't guard against fraud. This is where mining comes into place. Miners run specific programs on their computer that verify bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency transactions. It is when special algorithms (special math problems) are used to verify transactions between people. When a person mines he/she gets a little amount of bitcoin, this creates an incentive for people to get into the mining network As miners verify transactions, the more of them means a more secure network as there are more ledgers to check for fraud. The bitcoin network increases the difficulty of the algorithm as they are being solved faster and faster. As a lot of people are keeping track of the same thing the information is always accurate. For example, if one person tries to cheat the system and make him/her some money the others will remove that error and fix it with what they have. To make sure that people keeping the ledgers know you are sending bitcoin, you announce; your account number, the recipient’s account number and the number of bitcoins.</p>

            <h2>Sending and Receiving</h2>
            <p>To own and receive bitcoins you need to create a wallet, this wallet when made will have two keys; a private key and a public key. When you send some bitcoins to another person over the network, you’re essentially sending a piece of data that contains your public key, how many bitcoins you want to send and the recipient's account number. This whole package of data is digitally signed with your private key. When the data gets sent, miners perform hash functions to determine if the private key matches the public key. Before, successfully completing the transaction the bitcoin network checks if the sender has enough bitcoin in his/her wallet. If yes the transaction gets added to everyone’s ledgers and the recipient gets the bitcoin. If no, then the network rejects this transaction.</p>
